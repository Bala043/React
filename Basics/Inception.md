### ‚ùì What is `crossorigin` in the script tag?

The `crossorigin` attribute is used to handle **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** requests.

It allows the browser to fetch resources like scripts from another domain **securely**.

#### Syntax:
```html
<script crossorigin="anonymous|use-credentials" src="..."></script>
```

**Why is it important?**
- Enables better error reporting in React 16+
- Works only if the CDN provides the header:  
  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`

|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| You call the library functions   | Framework calls your code          |
| More flexible                    | More opinionated, structured       |
